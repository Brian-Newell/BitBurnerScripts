# BitBurnerScripts
Scripts I put together to get the job done.

## BruteBackdoor.js
Attempts to backdoor all servers, provided they have root access.
This does NOT require the singularity unlocks as it simply feeds to commands directly to the terminal. Due to this nature, this script MUST be left to run without any interruptions and the terminal must be in view at all times.

'So grab some grub choom and relax!'

### Examples
[home/] run BruteBackdoor.js
[home/] run BruteBackdoor.js --timeout 1 --maxwait 360
